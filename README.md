- Mouse free link navigation and management
- Command autocomplete
- Beautiful wallpapers
- Command history for repeating commands easily
- Stores bookmarks on your machine so they persist past your session

## How to use
The main reason why I adopted HomeTerm was to reduce my mouse reliance. HomeTerm is designed like a file system
-  files are like executables that take you to your page
-  folders are like organizers that you can use to group your links together
and this really makes the user experience very intuitable and straightforward.

 Hometerm has also made the no mouse journey more enjoyable than ever before: create, view, organize and navigate your links all from the comfort of the command line! To get started is very simple:

1. Save some links using `touch`.
2. View your links using `ls`.
3. Go to your pages with `./`.

The key reasons HomeTerm is preferable over other solutions (or at least why I like it): 
1. Completely pointer free interface: never touch your mouse!
2. Really, really fast to navigate with tab-autocomplete and history (up/down arrows).
3. Allows you to organize many many links with nested directories.

## How to setup
As of the time of writing this, it is currently waiting review to be uploaded into the Chrome Web Store.

However, to use from git:
1. Clone this repo anywhere
2. See [Google Chrome support â€” Manage app or extension folders](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/2714278?hl=en#:~:text=Go%20to%20chrome%3A%2F%2Fextensions,the%20app%20or%20extension%20folder.) on how to load an unpacked extension -- the /HomeTerm directory is the file you point to.

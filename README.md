## Theming

![Terminal Themes](/media/theming.png)

TermForm supports custom terminal themeing and some cool built-in themes.

- Dark & Light Default
- Grey scale Dark
- LaserWave
- Nord
- Dracula

The theming for the site is done through css variables.
To add your own theme just:

- add a new class for your `<body>` with the name you want your theme to be called
- add all of the existing variables with your theme values. (Theme variable defaults can be found under the :root definition)
- add the class name to the `THEMES` array in `src/cli.js` so the terminal knows about it

You should now be able to switch to your theme using the terminal!

> Feel free to submit PRs or open issues to get _popular_ themes added to this project!

## Fixing issues

Your TermPage file structure is stored in your browsers LocalStorage, if you encounter any bugs you can solve them by either modifying _(open an issue for help)_ or deleting your LocalStorage. **Please submit isses for any bugs you find!**
